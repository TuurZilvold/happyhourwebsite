					3G and 4G have been around for quite some time, and nothing strange occurs. But as soon as the 5G network is released a virus

            <h3> The theory</h3>

            <p>
            <p>
                Just like the 3G and 4G networks, 5G is a new and "better" mobile internet network, but in contrast to the two
                older generations of mobile internet 5g is being constructed by the Chinese. The same country where the Covid-19
                virus first broke out. The corona virus broke out in Wuhan which was one of the first places to get 5G. The way 5G
                causes Covid is by causing radiation which in turn triggers the virus or at least fastens the spreading of the virus and weakens the immune
                system. If you stand under a 5G tower you can also feel a tinteling sensation in your skin, this is the virus entering your
                body and also spreading through and damaging it.
            </p>


            <div id="paragraaf2">
                <h3>Why does china spread corona?</h3>

                <p>
                    China wants to use 5G to spread the corona virus, which isn't actually a real virus, it's a bioweapon. China wants to use this
                    to get the world into lockdown so a lot of small companies in other countries get weakened or go bankrupt, because China has a lot
                    of things they can produce very cheaply in very big quantaties. So if other companies go bankrupt, but the ones in China don't, the
                    world becomes even more dependent on China. Which they can use to gain power in military and economicaly because the wealth of the
                    country will grow.

                    In the picture to the right you can clearly see people who are even wearing masks still suffering from covid-19 because of the 5G towers.

                <h3>It's impossible because of the following points:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                           The corona virus is in countries that don’t yet have 5G towers.</td>
                           <br />At the start of the pandemic there were very few cases of covid in Africa, which would have made sense because there were no towers yet there, however there
                                    are many cases now. Iran doesn’t have 5G installed yet but has lots and lots of cases. So that's why this theory has been proven wrong.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        
                                    Covid-19 can’t be carried by electromagnetic waves.
                             
                                    <br />We have been studying viruses for years
                                    and we know quite well how they work, a virus just can’t be spread by radio waves. There are loads of known ways of transmission
                                    for a virus, and electromagnetic waves can’t transmit it, because they don’t even have mass. Also the 3G and 4G viruses have been
                                    around for a long time and no virus broke out when they were launched.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3G and 4G have been launched quite long ago.
                           
                                    <br />Nothing major happened, no virus no nothing. So it’s
                                    quite hard to believe that 5G causes Covid, just because China happens to be arranging for the network.
