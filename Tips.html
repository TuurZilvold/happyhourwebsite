                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Look at the source:</b>
                        <br />Look at the source of the article and see if it has a good reputation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Be critical towards the article:</b>
                        <br />Always be critical and ask yourself questions such as: With what intention was this article written? Is it too good to be true?.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Inspect the evidence:</b>
                        <br />Does the evidence definitely prove something and has the evidence not been selected or corrupted to support a particular statement?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Look at the author:</b>
                        <br />Check if the author is experienced on the subject he's writting and if he has written more articles about that subject.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Do an online check on the article:</b>
                        <br />Search the article with the word hoax or myth to see if other people have confirmed or disproved the article.
