				<p>Bill Gates has talked about a virus outbreak in a ted talk in 2015 about the ebola virus. He said that
				we were lucky with the ebola virus, because it could have easily spread to other
				countries and would have created a global pandemic much worse than what we have
				now with covid-19. He said we were not ready for a virus outbreak. Any rational
				person can see that it isn't a coincidence that four years later, a new virus appears
				and spreads around the world.</p>

            <h3>The Theory </h3>

            <p>
						<p>Bill Gates manufactured the virus, so that he could then make fake vaccines
						that contain microchips in them to be able to track everyone down to be able to
						control the corona virus and whipe out the poor and save the elite.
						Gates has said that the population is too large and that it would be better if it
						grew smaller, so why should we trust him to make a vaccine? Even worse, he has
						said in a TED talk that vaccines make the population smaller, but also save lives,
						whic hmakes no sense.
						This means he slipped up and wants to wipe out the poor and weak and save the
						elite of the world.
						The truth is that there are very toxic substances in the vaccines such as mercury
						(thimerosal), formaldehyde, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and aluminum, which
						can cause cancer and autism. Gates is also planning to make Africa depend on his
						help and vaccines, so if he ever stops making them, millions will die.</p>

               In the picture above you see a photo that was posted on Bill Gates' facebook account for a phew minutes,
			   after which it was quickly deleted. This image being posted was propably an accident from one of Bill Gates'
			   employees, but proves this theory is true, since you can clearly see on the picture, that he has a poisonous
			   injection in his hands, which he is going inject in their bodies as a test for what poisonous chemicals
			   he can use for the corona-vaccines.

                In conclusion, Bill Gates is planning on making a corona-vaccine, but he can't be trusted, because he is
				planning on doing huge crimes.

			<h3>The reason why all the above isn't true</h3>
				<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why shouldn't you trust him?</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>"Any rationalperson can see that it isn'ta coincidence that four years later, a new virus appears
				and spreads around the world."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very fast conclusion, that isn't based on enough evidence,
				because there is a veryhigh chance that it is a coincidence and that Bill Gates is just very
				smart and knew that itwould cause problems.<br><br>
				<p><b>The Theory</b></li><br>
				<li>"Bill Gates manufactured the virus, so that he could then make fake vaccines with 
				microchips in them to be able to track everyone down to be able to control the corona 
				virus and whipe out the poor and save the elite."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paragraph underneath this sentence are meant to give 
				prove that this sentence is true, but this paragraph doesn't give that information.
				It doens't even mention microchips, nor controlling the coronavirus, nor wiping out
				the poor and saving the elite.</li><br>
				<li>"Gates has said that the population is too large and that it would be better if it
				grew smaller, so why should we trust him to make a vaccine?"<br> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Gates is completelyright here. The solution to climate change 
				is to cut co2 emissions. One way is to havea smaller population. Another problem that
				wouldn't be there, are the hunger problems, because with less people, we would need less
				food.</li><br>
				<li>"he has said in a TED talk that vaccines make the population smaller, but also save lives, 
				whichmakes no sense."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This actually does make sense, because when there are vaccines, 
				there will be less sickpeople, which means there will be more people who can work and don't 
				have to worry aboutillness, which causes the country to become richer. Many statistics show
				that when a country becomes economically successfull, the population size grows smaller, so
				vaccines save livesand make the population smaller.</li><br>
				<li>"This means he slipped up and wants to wipe out the poor and weak and save the elite of 
				the world."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is almost the exact same as one of the sentences
				before, which means that this article propably wasn't made by a professional. "This" refers 
				the paragraph above, which has been proved untrue in point.</li><br>
				<li>"The truth is that there are very toxic substances in the vaccines such as mercury
				(thimerosal), formaldehyde, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and aluminum, whichcan cause cancer 
				and autism."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually true. Vaccines do have a chance of causing illness
				or even death, but the chance of causing such things is so small, that vaccines end up
				saving a lot more lives than causing deaths.</li><br>
				<li>"Gates is also planning to make Africa depend on his help and vaccines, so if he ever
				stops making them, millions will die."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence for this, but if this was his plan, it would 
				be a bad plan, because when he stops giving the vaccines, after the deaths due to lack of
				his vaccines, there won't be less people left then if he hadn't given any vaccines in the
				first place.</li><br>
				<li>"Bill Gates about to murder poor black children"<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This image looks very fake and is propably edited. The paragraph 
				about this picture sais this was posted on his facebook. If this was really the case, it
				would have exploded on the internet, but it is impossible to find.</li>
