    The corona virus isn't a natural virus, it is a bioweapon made to help the world to become
    a communist empire. The virus was made in a lab in Wuhan, but it accidently escaped and the Chinese government covered it up as an animal to man virus transfer. Why does the Chinese government want to make the world communist and how is it planning to do that with the help of covid-19? You will find out in this article.

    The Chinese government wants to make the world communist because they want to exert more power. It is very easy to manipulate people with the help of communism because they all get treated in the same way. The core value of communism is, as we all know, equality in every way. Because of that equality it is much easier to exert power on people and manipulate them because they don’t have a frame of reference because everyone is equal. While the government and the elite are exercising communism on the public, they are enjoying the perks of pure capitalism themselves. The elite knows the shortcomings of communism very well and they’re just using it for the sake of exercising more power on the public. Hence they don’t really believe in communism and its ideology and are actually using the capitalistic system to keep that regime a float.

    But how is the Chinese government going to achieve the so named world domination of communism with the coronavirus? That is a far more difficult
    question to answer. The first part of that answer lies in the way countries deal with the virus and the extermination of it. The governments of
    most countries decided it was the best to put the whole of their society in a strict lockdown where all people are separated from each other. Those
    governments are of course part of the ‘communistic plan’ and probably made sure it is covered up very well so that nobody can point fingers at them. In a lockdown it is a lot easier to target people with communist propaganda without them fully knowing what is going on and no possibility to check with others, due to social distancing. The latter affecting the opportunity of people to sense check information and put it into perspective.

    The second part of the answer lies in the way that the Chinese government reacted to the virus in the first place. At first the Chinese government didn’t disclose anything about
    the virus and suppressed doctors to tell it to the media and the public. This implies that the virus wasn’t supposed to be set free and confirms it was
    manmade: why else did the Chinese government keep it a secret for so long? Later a cover up story was composed that implied that the virus came from a wet market in the district of Wuhan.

    In conclusion, the Chinese government and the elite are not to be trusted. They have a second agenda and don’t want to help the people become freer and more independent. They
    only strive for more power and they achieve that goal with the help of the corona virus and the lockdown it causes.

    <h2>Debunking of the article</h2>
    <p>
    This article is fake and to see that you will have to look at it very closely. Firstly, none of the accusations made in this article are backed up by evidence and there are no references to sources. This is a red flag because you can't check this information, so this could all be made up. Secondly some things in this article are verifiable untrue. For example the text in the second image doesn't say "join forces to prevent covid-19" but it just says "stay at home, wear a mask and wash your hands to stop the spread of covid-19". Thirdly, some statements in this article don’t explain anything, such as the second part of the answer of the question of how covid-19 is used to achieve world domination. Lastly, there is nothing known about the author and you can't check if he has experience on the subject, he/she is writing about. So always make sure that the information that is given in the article is legit by checking with other sources and make sure that the author is experienced and has written other articles on the subject.
