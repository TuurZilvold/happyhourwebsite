    The corona virus isn't a natural virus, it is a bioweapon made to help the world to become
    a communist empire. The virus was made in a lab in Wuhan, but is accidently escaped and
    the chinese government covered it up as an animal to man virus transfer. Why does the chinese
    government want to make the world communist and how is it planning to do that with the help of
    covid-19? You will find out in this article.

    The chinese government wants to make the world communist because they want to exert more power.
    It is very easy to manipulate people with the help of communism because they all get treated in the same way.
    The core value of communism is, as we all know, equality in every way. Because of that equality it is much easier
    to exert power on people and manipulate them because they don’t have a frame of reference. While the government and
    the elite are exercising communism on the public, they are themselves enjoying the perks of pure capitalism.
    The elite know the shortcomings of communism very well and they’re just using it for the sake of exercising more
    power on the public. Hence they don’t really believe in communism and its ideology and are actually using the
    capitalistic system to keep that regime a float.

    But how is the chinese government going to achieve the sonamed world domination of communism with the coronavirus? That is a far more difficult
    question to answer. The first part of that answer lies in the way countries deal with the virus and the extermination of it. The governments of
    most countries decided it was the best to put the whole of their country in a strict lockdown where all people are separated from each other. Those
    governments are of course in the scandal and probably made sure it is covered up very well so that nobody can point fingers at them. With the lockdown
    and the separation of people it was a lot easier to target people with communist propaganda without them fully knowing what is going on. And without very
    good contact between people it is hard to put things into perspective because you only have your opinion and the opinion of the small group of people around
    you. So it is easier for people to believe that propaganda in lockdown because of the lack of communication and the desperation for the lockdown to stop.
    The second part lies in the way that the chinese government reacted to the virus in the first place. At first the chinese government didn’t disclose anything about
    the virus and suppressed doctors not to tell it to the media and the public. That means that the virus wasn’t supposed to be set free at that time and confirms it was
    manmade: why else did the chinese government keep it a secret for so long? Later a cover up story was composed that implied that the virus came from a wet market in the district of wuhan.

    In conclusion, the chinese government and the elite are not to be trusted. They have a second agenda and don’t want to help the people become more free and independent. They
    only strive for more power and money and they achieve that goal with the help of the corona virus and the lockdown it causes.

    <h2>Debunking of the article</h2>
    <p>
    This article is fake and to see that you will have to look at it very closely.
    Firstly none of the accusations made in this article are backed up
    by evidence and there are no references to other sources. This is a red flag
    because you can't check this information with other sources and there is no
    evidence so this could all be made up. Secondly some things in this article
    are also completely made up. For example the text in the second image doesn't say
    "join forces to prevent covid-19" but it just says "stay at home, wear a mask
    and wash your hands to stop the spread of covid-19".
    Lastly, there is nothing known about the author and you can't check if he has experience
    on the subject he/she is writting about. So always make sure that the
    information that is given in the article is legit by checking with other sources and make 
    sure that the author is experienced and has written other articles on the subject.
